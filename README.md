This is a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) for a Java AWS SDK v1 bug report.

All the relevant code is contained in [App.java](src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java) with decent comments.

To compile the project, run `mvn clean compile assembly:single` from the root folder.

To run the project, run `java -jar target/aws-sdk-sscce-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` from the root folder.

As this is meant to demonstrate an error with SSO credential validation, you'll need to have a default SSO profile configured.
